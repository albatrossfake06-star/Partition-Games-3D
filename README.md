# Partition Games

A comprehensive web application featuring **12 combinatorial partition games**, built to support research in combinatorial game theory at **Rhodes College**.

Developed under the **Rhodes College Summer Fellowship '25** by [Soumitro](mailto:dwiso-28@rhodes.edu) and [Aayan](mailto:debaa-28@rhodes.edu), supervised by [Prof. Eric Gottlieb](https://www.rhodes.edu/bio/eric-gottlieb).

## Available Games

### Impartial Games

| Game | Description |
|------|-------------|
| **LCTR** (Left Column Top Row) | Remove the leftmost column or the top row. Classic impartial game with Sprague-Grundy AI. |
| **CRIM** (Column Row Immediate Merge) | Remove any row or column; divided parts merge after each move. |
| **CRIS** (Column Row Independent Splits) | Same moves as CRIM, but fragments remain independent. |
| **Sato-Welter** | Remove a hook shape (upside-down L) from any square, eliminating all squares to the right and below. |
| **RIT** (Row Inequality Theorem) | Remove cells from a row if it has equal or more cells than the row below. |
| **Corner** | Remove random subsets of corner pieces from uniform partitions. |
| **AntiCorner** | Sato-Welter style moves targeting anti-corner positions. |
| **Continuous Corner** | Select consecutive ranges of corner pieces. |
| **CRIT** (Column Row Inequality Theorem) | Enhanced RIT with both row and column comparison moves. |
| **SCC** (Strict Continuous Corner) | Must begin with topmost or bottommost corner; sequential subset selection. |

### Partizan Games

| Game | Description |
|------|-------------|
| **CRPM** (Column Row Partizan Merge) | Player A removes rows, Player B removes columns. Partizan version of CRIM. |
| **CRPS** (Column Row Partizan Splits) | Player A controls rows, Player B controls columns in fragment partitions. |

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- A modern web browser (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge)
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (for multiplayer server)

### Running Locally

**1. Clone the repository:**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/labibibnmuzahid/Partition-Games.git
cd Partition-Games
```

**2. For single-player games:**

Open `index.html` directly in your browser, or start a local server:

```bash
# Python 3
python -m http.server 8000

# Node.js
npx serve .
```

Then visit `http://localhost:8000`.

**3. For multiplayer functionality:**

```bash
cd server
npm install
npm start
```

## Multiplayer

Real-time competitive play powered by WebSocket connections.

- **Room-based matching** with shareable room codes
- **Cross-platform** — play on any device
- **Synchronized game state** with automatic reconnection
- **Spectator mode** for observing matches

**How to play:**
1. Navigate to the multiplayer landing page
2. Create a new room or join with a room code
3. Share the code with your opponent
4. Play once both players have joined

Currently available for **Corner** and **LCTR** games.
